# Adaptive-Huffman-Coding-Text-Compression-
Place your txt file which has to be compressed in the code directory.
For Encoding,
  Compile encode.cpp code - g++ encode.cpp
  Run the code - ./a.out <input_filename> <output_filename>
  where input file will be compressed and encoded into the output file.
For Decoding,
  Compile decode.cpp code - g++ decode.cpp
  Run the code - ./a.out <input_filename> <output_filename>
  where input file will be uncompressed and decoded into the output file.
